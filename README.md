### What I learned

In this project, I extensively practice the modal component and its interactions with other elements of the page. It was a great challenge. Now I feel comfortable with working with modals.

### Continued development

After learning how to deal with the modal component, now I am ready to practice with the slider component. For this purpose, I will take a challenge which focus mainly on the slider component.
